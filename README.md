# Screen Marker Groups

Screen Marker Groups allows you to draw boxes and shapes on top of your RuneLite client and organize them into different groups. This plugin enhances the original RuneLite 
[Screen Markers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screen-Markers) by adding organizational capabilities.

This is useful for setting up markers for specific tasks, bosses, or activities, and easily switching between different sets of markers without cluttering your screen.

    *   *Rename:* Changes the group's name (cannot rename "Unassigned" or "Imported").
    *   *Delete:* Removes the group. You'll be asked if you want to delete its markers or move them to "Unassigned". ("Unassigned" cannot be deleted).

### Importing

*   **Import from Original Plugin:** Go to the plugin's settings menu (wrench icon next to the plugin name in the main RuneLite settings). Click the checkbox next to **"Import Screen markers"** to copy all markers from the original "Screen Markers" plugin into a new group called "Imported". This is useful for migrating your existing markers.
    *   *Note:* A client restart might be needed in order for the imported screen markers to appear correctly.
